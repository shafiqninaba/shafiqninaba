## Overview

SneakerHive is an e-commerce web application designed for sneaker enthusiasts. It allows users to explore trending footwear, save favorites, track orders, and subscribe to newsletters. The platform also includes admin tools for managing inventory and reviewing product statistics.

## Key Features

- **Trending Footwear Showcase**: Display of popular sneakers directly on the homepage.
- **Product Favorites**: Logged-in users can like sneakers to view them later.
- **Category Browsing**: Products are neatly categorized for faster discovery.
- **Smooth Checkout Process**: Clean and intuitive checkout experience.
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Users can sign up for product news and drops.
- **Account Creation & Order Tracking**: Users can register, log in, and view their orders.
- **Administrative Page**: Admin dashboard to manage sneaker stock and monitor analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core frontend implementation.
- **PHP**: Backend logic for handling authentication, inventory, and order flow.
- **MySQL**: Structured relational database to manage user, product, and order data.
- **XAMPP**: Local server environment for development and testing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was integrating a dynamic admin interface for non-technical users while keeping the backend secure and maintainable. Ensuring smooth data flow between the client UI and MySQL via PHP also required careful structuring. We also encountered hurdles while optimizing the UI for responsiveness across different screen sizes. Through trial and error, we gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development, database management, and building robust user authentication systems.

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrates a full-stack e-commerce platform tailored for sneaker enthusiasts. It provides a seamless user experience, from browsing to checkout, while also offering powerful admin tools for inventory management. This project not only solidified my skills in web development but also deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in building a full-fledged e-commerce application.
